## Night at the Museum

At N@TM, I got to see all of the computer science classes — CSSE, AP CSP, and AP CSA — showcase their major achievements from this trimester and explain how their projects worked. Many of the AP CSP projects were impressive games or interactive courses (Aniska's group, for instance, had built a course teaching ), while AP CSA's projects felt especially relevant to what we do in CSSE. One highlight for me was seeing Xavier's group, who had actually helped develop the game builder we used for our RPG game — I thought that connection was really cool.
