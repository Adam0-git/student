### Trimester in Review
This trimester was about more than learning how to code, or how javascript worked.
My biggest lesson I gained from this class is working in groups and not solely relying on myself or others skill sets to complete a task. Even if we're not perfect, we can still complete the task as a team.

Overall, CSSE 1 taught me how to code and has taught me vocab words in coding. I have also learned teamwork

- I have learned to work with an operating system and effectively use developer tools
- I have learned to manage my classwork alongside with work on computer science all together
- I have learned to be patient, to keep working through each mistake until it works
- I have learned to trial and error my code

I'll get into more detail about my journey and accomplishments below.

# As a Teacher
- I learned how present my content to individuals who have little to no experience, as well as how to simplify advanced content to be consumed by others easily and understandably
- I learned how to interact with students and help ensure they understand content, even when some may not openly ask questions

# As a Student
- I learned more about how to effectivley communicate with a teacher or student teacher
- I learned more about understanding a teacher's goals in teaching and how to implement my own knowledge to help others if needed

# Achievements in these roles
- In all of these roles, I think my biggest achievement is making and meeting new people to talk with
- We also all worked together to make fun hacks and a (somewhat) functional class game

### Learning to code
I've learned lots about coding this trimester and I hope to learn more later in the future

## Learning setup
Learning our tools setup was probably the hardest part of the class because there was always something completley new to learn.
- I learned how to create and manage repos, use github and VS Code effectivley
