From these homeworks, I was able to learn about different ways to code using Javascript.

<h2>Homeworks (please copy and paste the links on a new tab)</h2>

(Arrays) Short explanation: This is how data is stored, using an index as a label for each item within the array.        https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-07-arrays.ipynb

(Data Abstraction) Short explanation: This is what is presented. What the frontend shows vs what the backend has. Illustrates what wants to be shown.       https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-09-data_abstraction.ipynb

(Iteration) Short explanation: This is how code loops to automate tasks and help remove excessive code.           https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-12-iteration-homework.ipynb

(JSON) Short explanation: This is a language that helps organize information.          https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-16-json_lesson.ipynb

(Booleans) Short explanation: This is how code determines decisions and evaluates conditions. It uses only 2 values which are true or false.         https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-20-booleans-lessons.ipynb

(Nested Conditionals) Short explanation: This is how computers sees options and makes a decision. It uses If or Else statements.          https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2025-01-08-NestedConditionals-Homework.ipynb

(Mathematical Expressions) Short explanation: This is how numbers are calculated. By using variables and operators to calculate integers.     https://github.com/Adam0-git/student/blob/main/2026-01-20-math-exp.ipynb
